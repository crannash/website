<p>The general scheme of this set of notes is to lay the microscopic framework for macroscopic thermodynamics, and then show that we can actually recover the phenomenological laws of thermodynamics from our microscopic description.</p>
<p>A very reasonable response to this goal is to ask the question: “What does it mean to lay a microscopic framework?” In a very vague sense, what we want to do is develop a set of mathematical objects defined in terms of microscopic variables which provide a connection between a very specific microscopic configuration of particles and a macroscopic quantity (often referred to as an <strong>observable</strong>).</p>
<p>Consider a system of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles. By Newton’s Second Law, we can write down an equation for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_i (\mathbf{r}_i)\)</span>, the force on the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th particle as a function of its position:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{F}_i (\mathbf{r}_i) = m \mathbf{a}_i (\mathbf{r}_i) = m \frac{d\mathbf{v}_i (\mathbf{r}_i)}{dt} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}_i (\mathbf{r}_i)}{dt} \]</span></p>
<p>This then implies that if we know the positions <span class="math inline">\(\{ \mathbf{r}_1, ..., \mathbf{r}_N \}\)</span> and momenta <span class="math inline">\(\{ \mathbf{p}_1, ..., \mathbf{p}_N \}\)</span> of each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> particles in our system, we can fully describe the force on each particle (and therefore the dynamics of the system) with the set of <span class="math inline">\(6N\)</span> coordinates, <span class="math inline">\(\{ \mathbf{r}_1, ..., \mathbf{r}_N, \mathbf{p}_1, ..., \mathbf{p}_N \}\)</span> (Note that this is a set of <span class="math inline">\(6N\)</span> coordinates because each position and momentum has 3 scalar components).</p>
